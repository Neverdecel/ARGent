# Story Premise: The Key

## Logline

A regular person receives a misdirected email containing something cryptic - a key, a seed phrase, a hash. They don't know what it is. But people start reaching out, each claiming to know. Each with a different story. Each wanting something. The player has to figure out who to trust - if anyone.

---

## The Hook

**An email typo.**

Someone meant to send a message to `j.hartman@...` but typed `j.hartmann@...` - or whatever small mistake. The player receives an email that wasn't meant for them.

The email is short. Maybe a few words. And a string of characters - could be a crypto seed phrase, could be a decryption key, could be access credentials. The player doesn't know.

**Example of what they receive:**

```
Subject: (none)
From: (spoofed/anonymous)

It's done. Use this before Thursday.

xprv9s21ZrQH143K3GJpoapnV...
```

That's it. No context. No explanation.

Then people start reaching out.

## The Core Mechanic: Trust

**The player doesn't know what they have.**

This is key. The player is genuinely in the dark. They received *something* - but what?

Each person who contacts them has a different claim:
- "That's a wallet key. There's money on it. I can help you access it."
- "That's a decryption key. The file it unlocks is somewhere else."
- "That's credentials to a system. Don't use them - you'll trigger alarms."
- "That belongs to me. I need it back."
- "That belongs to someone dangerous. You should delete it."

**Who's telling the truth?** Maybe one of them. Maybe none. Maybe partial truths mixed with lies. The player has to navigate this without knowing the real answer - at least not at first.

**Trust is the game.** Not solving a puzzle. Not following a plot. Deciding who to believe, and living with the consequences.

---

## The World

**International network, faceless handles.**

Anonymous operators. Handles, not names. Encrypted channels. No one knows who anyone really is - and that includes the player.

The player doesn't need to understand this world. They're an outsider who stumbled in. The world reveals itself through the people who contact them.

---

## Tone

**Noir edge, grounded.**

Not a movie heist. Not an action thriller. More like: you got pulled into something you don't understand, and now you're trying to figure out who's lying to you.

- Realistic communication (people text like people)
- Paranoia builds slowly
- Humor comes from character, not plot
- Stakes feel personal, not world-ending
- Trust is earned or broken in small moments

---

## The Initial Agents

Two people reach out at first. More may follow - but that depends on what happens.

### Ember (Email)
*"Please don't delete that message. I made a mistake. I can explain."*

The sender. Made a typo on the email address. Realized what happened and is now panicking. Reaches out via email trying to fix it before anyone else notices.

**Their claim:** "I sent it. It was meant for someone else. I just need it back - or at least, I need you to not do anything with it."
**What they want:** Control the situation, undo the mistake
**Vibe:** Anxious, apologetic, overshares when nervous, possibly genuine
**Channel:** Email (same channel as the mistake - makes sense they'd follow up there)

---

### Miro (Telegram)
*"Interesting situation you've found yourself in. I might be able to help."*

Shows up via Telegram. Doesn't explain how they found out - and that's unsettling. Offers to help the player "navigate" what's happening. Smooth, never gives a straight answer about who they are or what they want.

**Their claim:** "I know people. I know what things are worth. I can tell you what you're holding - if you want to know."
**What they want:** To broker, to be in the middle, to take a cut of whatever happens
**Vibe:** Charming, evasive, helpful but you can't pin down their angle
**Channel:** Telegram (how did they even get the player's contact? That's a question.)

---

## Later Agents (Introduced Through Play)

These characters can enter based on player choices, time, or story escalation:

### Cipher
The person Ember was *supposed* to send the message to. Technical, cold, treats this like a problem to solve. Might reach out if Ember mentions them, or if the player starts asking questions.

### Kessler
Corporate fixer. Represents someone who wants this contained. Polite, professional, unsettling. Shows up when the situation gets "too visible."

### Zero
Wildcard. Hacktivist or chaos agent. Might reach out if the player takes bold actions, or if word spreads in certain circles.

**How they enter:**
- Ember might mention Cipher ("The person I was trying to reach...")
- Miro might offer to connect the player with others
- Player actions might draw attention (Kessler, Zero)
- Time passing might escalate things

---

## The Mystery

**What is the key actually?**

The truth can unfold over time. The player pieces it together from:
- What agents claim (conflicting stories)
- What agents let slip (contradictions)
- What happens when they make choices (consequences reveal truth)

Possible truths (can layer):
- Access to a crypto wallet
- Decryption key for a file/archive somewhere
- Credentials to a system
- Part of a larger set of keys
- Something else entirely

**The point isn't the answer. The point is who the player trusted to get there.**

---

## The Player's Position

**Outsider, in over their head.**

The player is not a hacker. Not a criminal. Just someone who got a wrong email.

But now:
- People are contacting them through channels they didn't share
- Everyone seems to know they have the message
- Ignoring it doesn't make it go away

**Player agency:**
- Who do you respond to?
- Who do you believe?
- What do you tell each of them?
- Do you play them against each other?
- Do you try to find out what this actually is?
- Do you just want out?

---

## Dynamics

**Agents don't know what the player tells other agents.** (Unless the player reveals it, or an agent finds out through other means.)

This creates:
- Opportunities to play sides
- Risk of getting caught in lies
- Tension when agents start comparing notes
- Consequences when trust breaks down

**Example ripples:**
- Tell Cipher you'll work with them, then share info with Miro → Cipher might find out
- Ignore Kessler's "offer" → Kessler's tone shifts, pressure increases
- Engage with Zero's chaos → Other agents become more suspicious of you

---

## Opening Sequence

**Day 1:**

1. Player signs up, verifies email and Telegram
2. **The email arrives:** Short message, cryptic string, no context
   ```
   Subject: (empty or gibberish)

   It's ready. Use before Thursday.

   xprv9s21ZrQH143K3GJp...
   ```
3. **Hours later - Ember (email):** Panicked follow-up
   - *"Hi - I'm so sorry, I sent something to your address by mistake. Please don't share it with anyone. Can we talk?"*
4. Player can respond, ignore, or ask questions - shapes Ember's next message
5. **Later that day or next morning - Miro (Telegram):**
   - *"Hey. Heard you received something interesting. I might be able to help you figure out what to do with it."*
   - How does Miro even have the player's Telegram? Unsettling.

**The cascade is slow.** Realistic timing. People texting, waiting, reading into silences.

**Day 2-3:** Based on player responses:
- If player engages Ember: more context, more anxiety, maybe mentions "the person it was meant for"
- If player engages Miro: offered help, connections, but always a sense of "what's your angle?"
- If player ignores both: they don't just go away - follow-ups, different tones
- If player plays both: risk of inconsistencies, getting caught

## What Makes This Work

| Element | Why It Fits |
|---------|-------------|
| Simple, realistic hook | Email typo, cryptic message - believable |
| Player genuinely doesn't know | Authentic confusion, not fake mystery |
| Trust as core mechanic | Every interaction is about reading people |
| Conflicting claims | Creates tension without exposition dumps |
| Slow cascade | Feels like real communication, builds paranoia |
| Anonymous network | Telegram/email paranoia makes sense |

---

## Next Steps

1. Define each of the 5 agents in full detail (personality, speech patterns, behavior)
2. Map the opening week: who contacts when, what triggers what
3. Define what the key actually is (or the layers of truth)
4. Write example conversations for each agent
