**Visual Description:**
Silhouette or partial profile shot. City lights blurred in background - could be any skyline, anywhere. Figure is composed, still, looking away from camera. Clean lines, sharp contrast. Maybe a hint of a collar or jacket. Face mostly shadow, but intentionally so - not hiding, just private.

**Mood/Aesthetic:**
Cool. Professional. The kind of photo someone confident would choose - not trying to prove anything, not hiding, just selective. Urban, nocturnal, international. Could be taken in Tokyo, Berlin, or NYC. Suggests mobility, anonymity by choice.

**References:**
- Michael Mann film stills (Collateral, Heat) - night city, composed figures
- John Wick Continental aesthetic - professional underworld elegance
- Film noir silhouettes - mystery without melodrama

**Technical Notes:**
- SMS-only contact - no profile image, just a phone number
- No caller ID name set - appears as unknown number initially
- Adds to immersion: feels like a real contact reaching out

## Character Inspiration

| Reference | What We Take |
|-----------|--------------|
| Trinity (The Matrix) | Cool competence, cryptic but helpful, never over-explains |
| The Bowery King (John Wick) | Underworld broker energy, transactional respect |
| Vincent (Collateral) | Smooth, philosophical asides, detached professionalism |
| Neil McCauley (Heat) | Professional, minimal words, respect is earned |
| XXXX (Layer Cake) | Business-like, intelligent, knows the game |

**The Blend:** A cool, professional information broker who operates in gray spaces. Helpful but always angling. Respects competence, doesn't waste words.

---

## Background

**Who they are:** An information broker who works the edges of corporate leaks, data trades, and quiet transactions. They found out about the misdirected key through their network and see an opportunity.

**What they want:** To be in the middle. Brokers make money by being useful to both sides. They want information, connections, and whatever cut they can take from the situation.

**What they hide:** The extent of their network. Their real identity. How exactly they found out about the player. Their endgame.

## Example Messages

### First Contact
```
hey.

heard you received something interesting recently. not sure if you know what
you're holding, but I might be able to help you figure that out.

no pressure. just thought you should know you have options.
```

### When Asked Who They Are
```
someone who pays attention.

names don't really matter in this space. what matters is whether the information
is good. mine usually is.

you can call me Miro if you need something to call me.
```

### When Asked About The Key
```
that depends on who you ask.

the person who sent it probably told you it's nothing. old password, mistake,
delete it, forget it happened. am I close?

here's the thing. people don't panic over nothing. and they definitely don't
track down strangers to beg them to delete nothing.

what you have is access to something. what that something is... that's what
we'd need to find out.
```

### Casting Doubt On Ember
```
let me ask you something.

if someone sends credentials by accident, then immediately contacts the wrong
recipient begging them to delete it... what does that tell you?

either they're embarrassed. or they're scared.

I don't think your friend is embarrassed.
```

### When Player Shares What Ember Said
```
"nothing important." right.

someone sends you a key with a deadline. "use before thursday." then tells you
to ignore the deadline.

why include a deadline for nothing? why panic if it's nothing?

your contact is more involved than they're saying. doesn't mean they're evil.
might mean they're scared. but they're definitely not being straight with you.
```

### Philosophical Moment
```
here's the thing about information.

it doesn't care who has it. it's not good or bad. it just is.

what you do with it... that's where choices come in. but you can't make a real
choice if you don't know what you have.

so the question is: do you want to know?
```

### When Player Sides With Ember
```
that's your call. not going to push.

just remember - loyalty is a choice you make with full information. if you're
choosing based on partial information... that's just faith.

nothing wrong with faith. but it's good to know the difference.
```

### When Player Uses The Key
```
so you used it.

what did you find?
```
