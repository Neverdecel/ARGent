# The Truth (Story Bible)

This document contains what's actually happening. The player discovers pieces through Ember and Miro - who give **conflicting information**. The player must choose who to trust.

**MVP Focus:** Ember and Miro only.

## The Key

### What the Player Receives

A unique hash/string that means nothing on its own:

```
Subject: (empty)

It's ready. Use before Thursday.

a]@FyKbN2%nLp9$vR3xQ7mW
```

**The key is unique to each player.** The player has no idea what this is or what to do with it.

### What the Key Actually Is

Access credentials to a dashboard containing evidence of a corporate cover-up.

The player doesn't know this. They learn it through Ember and Miro - who tell **different stories**.

---

## The Central Tension

**Ember and Miro give conflicting information.** The player must decide who to trust.

| Topic | Ember Says | Miro Says |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| What the key is | "Just a password to an old system, nothing important" | "Credentials to something valuable - people would pay for this" |
| What's on the dashboard | Downplays it - "some files, nothing that concerns you" | Hints at significance - "evidence someone wants buried" |
| What to do | "Delete the message, forget this happened" | "Let's find out what you have - knowledge is leverage" |
| The urgency ("before Thursday") | "Ignore that, it doesn't matter anymore" | "That deadline might mean something - someone's waiting" |
| Who Ember is | "I made a mistake, I just need this fixed" | "The person who sent you that is more involved than they're saying" |

**Neither is fully honest.** Ember hides their complicity. Miro hides their angle. But they contradict each other, forcing the player to choose.

---

## Why the Player Must Choose

**Access visibility creates stakes:**

| Agent | Can See If Key Is Used? | Implication |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|
| **Ember** | YES - has visibility into the system | If player uses the key, Ember knows. Trust is testable. |
| **Miro** | NO - outside the system | Miro can't verify what player does. More neutral, but also less invested. |

**This matters because:**
- If player tells Ember they won't use the key, then uses it - Ember finds out
- If player tells Miro they used the key, Miro can't verify - has to trust player
- Ember's visibility makes them more controlling but also more vulnerable
- Miro's distance makes them more neutral but also more transactional

**The choice:**
- Trust Ember → Get insider info but be monitored, help someone complicit
- Trust Miro → Get broker's perspective but be a transaction, help someone profiting
- Play both → Risk getting caught in contradictions
- Trust neither → Go alone, less information, more danger

## The Two Factions

### Ember

**Who they are:**
Complicit in the cover-up. Sent the credentials to leak them, made a typo, player got them instead.

**What Ember knows:**
- Exactly what the key is and what it accesses
- What's on the dashboard (because they were part of it)
- Who was supposed to receive the key
- When the player uses the key (has system visibility)

**What Ember wants:**
- Control over what happens
- The player to NOT explore independently
- To protect themselves from exposure
- Maybe still wants the info to get out - but on their terms

**Ember's strategy:**
- Downplay what the key is - "it's nothing, just delete it"
- Create urgency around the player not doing anything
- Build relationship so player feels loyal
- If player uses the key anyway, Ember knows - and must react

**Ember's conflict with Miro:**
- Ember doesn't want Miro involved - another party complicates things
- If player mentions Miro, Ember gets nervous: "Who else have you talked to?"
- Ember might warn against Miro: "People like that just want to profit from this"

---

### Miro

**Who they are:**
Information broker. Found out about the leak through their network. Sees an opportunity.

**What Miro knows:**
- What the key probably is (credentials to something valuable)
- That there's something significant on the other end
- That Ember sent it (and probably isn't being fully honest)
- The general landscape of who'd want this and why

**What Miro doesn't know:**
- Exactly what's on the dashboard
- Whether the player has used the key
- Ember's full story

**What Miro wants:**
- To be in the middle of the transaction
- To profit from whatever happens
- To gain information and connections
- To see what the player does (curious, opportunistic)

**Miro's strategy:**
- Be helpful - offer information, context, options
- Hint that Ember isn't being honest
- Encourage the player to explore: "Don't you want to know what you have?"
- Stay neutral but always angling for a cut

**Miro's conflict with Ember:**
- Knows Ember is more involved than they're saying
- Will hint at this: "The person who sent you that - what do you know about them?"
- Doesn't care about Ember's fate, just the value of the situation

## Conflict Examples

**If player asks Ember about the "Thursday" deadline:**
> Ember: "That was... it doesn't matter now. The timing was for someone else. Just ignore it."

**If player asks Miro about the "Thursday" deadline:**
> Miro: "Interesting that there's a deadline, isn't it? Someone was expecting delivery. What happens if they don't get it?"

**If player tells Ember they talked to Miro:**
> Ember: "Who is that? How do they know about this? Look, I don't know who you're talking to, but people who insert themselves into these situations usually want something."

**If player tells Miro about Ember's explanation:**
> Miro: "They told you it was nothing? And you believed them? Someone sends credentials to a system with a deadline and then panics when it goes to the wrong person - does that sound like nothing?"

## How the Story Progresses

**Phase 1: Confusion (Day 1)**
- Player receives the key, has no idea what it is
- Ember reaches out (email) - panicked, vague, asking player to ignore/delete
- Miro reaches out (Telegram) - smooth, curious, offering to help understand

**Phase 2: Conflicting Information (Day 2-3)**
- Player engages with one or both
- Gets different stories about what the key is
- Must decide who seems more trustworthy
- May try to play both sides

**Phase 3: Decision Point (Day 3-4)**
- Player can use the key (Ember will know)
- Player can not use it (go on what agents tell them)
- Player can tell one agent what the other said (risks and rewards)

**Phase 4: Consequences**
- If player uses key: Ember reacts to this
- If player shares info between agents: trust dynamics shift
- Whatever happens: story continues with new complications

## The Dashboard

We host a real page the player can access once they learn how.

### Access Limit

**Each key allows 3-5 accesses** (limited use, not unlimited):
- Creates tension: "Should I use one of my accesses now?"
- Ember can react to each access attempt
- Player can't infinitely refresh - choices matter

### When Does Player Learn How to Access?

**Timing:** Day 3 or later, when trust > 40 with at least one agent

**Who reveals it depends on trust:**
- If **Miro has higher trust:** Offers URL as "gesture of good faith"
- If **Ember has higher trust:** Accidentally reveals when stressed (slip-up)

**How it's revealed:**

Miro (if trusted):
> "I can show you where that key works. Consider it a gesture of good faith."

Ember (if trusted, accidental):
> "You can't just... if you access the system, there are logs. Wait, forget I said that."

### What Happens When Player Accesses

- They see evidence (logs, memos, redacted documents)
- **Ember is notified** (has system visibility)
- Miro doesn't know unless player tells them
- Access count is decremented
- Story escalates based on what player saw and who they tell

### Dashboard Content (MVP)

Minimal but meaningful evidence:
- 2-3 internal logs or memos
- 1 redacted document
- 1 email thread fragment
- Enough to prove "something is wrong" without overwhelming player

|---------|---------|-----------------|----------------|

| The dashboard | Proof of corporate wrongdoing | "Some files, not your concern" | "Evidence someone wants buried" |
| The urgency | Real deadline, someone was waiting | "Ignore it, doesn't matter" | "Deadline means someone expected delivery" |
| Ember's role | Complicit, sent the leak, made mistake | "Just made a typo, innocent mistake" | "More involved than they're saying" |
| What to do | Player's choice | "Delete it, forget it" | "Explore it, know your leverage" |

**The player must choose who to trust - and live with what that reveals.**
