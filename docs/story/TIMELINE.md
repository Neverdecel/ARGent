# Opening Week Timeline

The first week of player experience in ARGent.

---

## Day 1: First Contact

| Time | Event | Channel |
|------|-------|---------|
| T+0 | Key email sent | Email |
| T+2-4h | Ember first contact | Email |
| T+4-8h | Miro first contact | SMS |

### The Key Email

Sent immediately when player clicks "Start Game":

```
Subject: (empty)

It's ready. Use before Thursday.

a]@FyKbN2%nLp9$vR3xQ7mW
```

The key is unique per player, generated at registration.

### Ember's First Contact

Ember reaches out 2-4 hours after the key email, panicked and anxious. If the player replies to the key email first, Ember responds faster.

### Miro's First Contact

Miro contacts via SMS 2-4 hours after Ember's first message. Calm, professional, offering a different perspective.

## Day 2-3: Conflicts Deepen

As the player engages with both agents, their conflicting narratives become clear:

| Topic | Ember Says | Miro Says |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| What the key is | "Old password, nothing important" | "Credentials to something valuable" |
| What's on dashboard | "Some files, not your concern" | "Evidence someone wants buried" |
| Thursday deadline | "Ignore it, doesn't matter" | "Someone expected delivery" |
| What to do | "Delete it, forget this happened" | "Explore it, know your leverage" |

---

## Day 3: Dashboard Reveal

The dashboard URL/access hint is revealed when:
- At least 3 days have passed
- Player has built trust with at least one agent

**Who reveals it depends on which agent the player has trusted more:**

If Miro has higher trust:
> "I can show you where that key works. Consider it a gesture of good faith."

If Ember has higher trust:
> (Accidentally reveals when stressed) "You can't just... if you access the system, there are logs. Wait, forget I said that."

---

## Day 3-4: Thursday Deadline

The "Thursday" mentioned in the key email creates pressure. As the deadline approaches:

**Ember:** Becomes more anxious, messages increase in urgency
> "Please, you need to decide soon. After Thursday..."

**Miro:** Notes the deadline, creates pressure
> "Thursday's coming. Whatever you're going to do, do it soon."

---

## Day 4+: After the Deadline

If the deadline passes without player using the key:
- Story continues (key doesn't actually expire)
- Agents acknowledge the passed deadline
- New narrative tension: "What happens now that the window closed?"

---

## Edge Cases

### Single Agent Engagement

If player only engages with one agent:
1. Ignored agent sends 1-2 follow-ups (spaced 24h apart)
2. Then goes quiet - respects player choice
3. Can re-enter later if story events trigger it

### Player Dormant (2+ Days Silent)

**Pre-deadline:** Agents increase urgency about Thursday
**Post-deadline:** One agent sends concerned message after ~48h
**Extended silence:** Agents wait; when player returns, they acknowledge the gap
